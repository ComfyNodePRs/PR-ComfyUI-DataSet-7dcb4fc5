### Inputs

```
TextFilePathList: List of file paths ['path','path','path']
```
```
WordCloudTop: Integer will select top N data to make world cloud
```
```
NetworkGraphTop: Integer will select top N data to make network graph
```
```
FrequencyGraphTop: Integer will select top N data to make freqency graph
```

### Inputs

```
content: content string type
```
```
filename: name of the file without .txt extension
```
```
directory: the directory where the file will be saved
```
```
mode: Merge | Overwrite | SaveNew | MergeAndSaveNew
```

If directory does not exists new directory will be created.

#### Modes Explaination
  1. **Merge**: Old text in file content appended by new text content.
  2. **Overwrite**: Only new text content in file (if directory is a new directory without file it will create new file).
  3. **SaveNew**: Make a numbered file of original name with new text content.
  4. **MergeAndSaveNew**: Old text in file content appended by new text content and make SaveNew.
     
### Output

Text file in directory.

## 3. DRMN_TagManipulatorByImageNames

There may be a possiblity where you named your caption file with the same name as your image file (without extension üòÖ). 
This node is useful then. You can add a concept in all the caption files at once.

![image](https://github.com/daxcay/ComfyUI-DRMN/assets/164315771/55cca034-7ef0-45a7-b872-8732242a884f)

### Inputs

```
ImageNames: List of image names
```

Image names can be generated using this JDCN node

![image](https://github.com/daxcay/ComfyUI-DRMN/assets/164315771/1a35dd7e-e754-45e6-8d53-9493c7da5c7d)

```
Tags directory: directory of the caption files.
```
```
Backup: when true a backup folder with last version of file will be saved in tags directory given.
```
```
Concept: the concept you want to add in caption files.
```

### Concept writing format

```
concept int,concept int,concept int
```

where ```concept``` can be any string and ```int``` is the position of the "," in caption file where the addition will take place.


For example,
```
Caption:  a young woman, in red tshirt and black pant, day 

Concept: age 24 1,sunny 2

Result: a young woman, age 24, sunny, in red tshirt and black pant, day
```

```sunny``` should be after ```pant,``` but ended up after ```age 24``` because 2nd comma position was now 3rd after adding ```age 24```.


Concept will be written like this:

```
Caption:  a young woman, in red tshirt and black pant, day 

Concept: age 24 1,sunny 3

Result: a young woman, age 24, in red tshirt and black pant, sunny, day
```

In case you made an error you can use backup folder files.

### Output

Tags directory will have something like this.
